# TODO for CS Lab works

## Part 1. Calssical ciphers

---

### Lab №1

For this lab work 4 classical ciphers have to be implemented:

- [ ] Caesar cipher substitution
- [ ] Caesar cipher substitution + alphabet permutation
- [ ] Vigenere cipher
- [ ] Playfair cipher

---

## Part 2. Modern ciphers

---

### Lab №2. Symmetric ciphers.Stream ciphers. Block ciphers

For this lab work an example should be implemented for both a stream cipher and a block cipher.

- [ ] Stream cipher : SEAL
 <!--
    -[ ] apparently requires SHA-1 as part of key generation
    Fixed by using the openssl's libcrypto (maybe)
   -->
- [ ] Block Cipher : AES

### Lab work №3. Asymmetric ciphers

For this lab work an assymetric cipher has to be implemented

- [ ] Assyumetric cipher RSA
