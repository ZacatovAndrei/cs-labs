# TODO for CS Lab works

## Part 1. Calssical ciphers

---

### Lab №1

For this lab work 4 classical ciphers have to be implemented:

- [x] Caesar cipher substitution
- [x] Caesar cipher substitution + alphabet permutation
- [x] Vigenere cipher
- [x] Atbash cipher

---

## Part 2. Modern ciphers

---

### Lab №2. Symmetric ciphers.Stream ciphers. Block ciphers

For this lab work an example should be implemented for both a stream cipher and a block cipher.

- [x] Stream cipher : RC4
 <!--
    -[ ] apparently SEAL required SHA-1 as part of key generation
    Revering to the RC4 cipher
   -->
- [ ] Block Cipher : RC5

### Lab work №3. Asymmetric ciphers

For this lab work an assymetric cipher has to be implemented

- [ ] Assymetric cipher RSA
